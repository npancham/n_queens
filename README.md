# n_queens

This repository contains a python script for solving the n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n-by-n chessboard.
Multiple algorithms exist for solving the n queens problem, ranging from brute-force searches to more sophisticated techniques.
The algorithm used here is a backtracking depth-first search.
